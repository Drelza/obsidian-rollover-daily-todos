## Usage

If you use the Core Daily Note plugin, whenever you create a new daily note, any unchecked checkboxes from your last daily note will be brought over to your new daily note.

The plugin will look at the settings for the Daily Notes plugin to see where your daily notes are stored.

If you use a template for your daily note you can go to the plugin settings to select a header you would like the checkboxes to be added under.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed within the `Third-party Plugins` tab within Obsidian.
